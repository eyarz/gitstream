`gitStream` is a workflow automation tool to optimize your code review process.  
Add context to Pull Requests, find code experts for reviews, and automate the merge process to maximize developer productivity!

## Why gitStream and not GitHub Actions?

Think of gitStream as the Robin to your GitHub Actions Batman. It‚Äôs not here to replace GitHub Actions or other CI/CD pals like CircleCI or Jenkins. Instead, gitStream is optimized to enhance the [continuous merge process](https://linearb.io/blog/what-is-continuous-merge) for open-source projects with multiple contributors.

## Meet gitStream Bot: Your Code Review Sidekick!
gitStream bot can _shorten your code review cycles by a 40%_ with [built-in automation](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/automation-library/) like:

* **üè∑Ô∏è Enforce Semantic PR Titles** - enforce pull request naming conventions
* **üìä Calculate percent new code** - post a comment with the percentage of new code
* **üéØ Assign code experts** - assign recommended reviewers based on code components
* **üï∞Ô∏è Provide estimated time to review** - label PRs estimated number of minutes it would take to review

## Users loving gitStream

From small side projects to complex codebases, all types of open source communities love gitStream:
* [gradle/gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/tree/master/.cm) 15.2k ‚≠ê
* [gitcoinco/grants-stack](https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack/tree/main/.cm) 250 ‚≠ê
* [vim-zz/swordfish-rs](https://github.com/vim-zz/swordfish-rs/tree/main/.cm) 50 ‚≠ê
* [linear-b/gitstream](https://github.com/linear-b/gitstream/tree/main/.cm) (Yes, PRs to gitStream docs are also checked with gitStream ü§Ø)
  
## Getting started in two min

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Install the GitHub app**  
 gitStream is a verified GitHub app on the [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/gitstream-by-linearb), audited and approved by the GitHub Security team. 

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a `.cm/gitstream.cm` automations file in your repository**  
This file will contain a YAML configuration that determines the automations that run on every PR to the repository's default branch (usually _master_ or _main_).  
<br>
For example, this automation file will add a label with an [estimated time to review](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/provide-estimated-time-to-review/) for every new pull request:
![image](https://github.com/eyarz/gitstream/assets/19731161/a6a2338d-70e7-4d2b-8770-f1145092898e)

  ```yaml
  # -*- mode: yaml -*-
  # This example configuration for provides basic automations to get started with gitStream.
  # View the gitStream quickstart for more examples: https://docs.gitstream.cm/quick-start/
  manifest:
    version: 1.0
  automations:
    # Add a label indicating how long it will take to review the PR.
    estimated_time_to_review: 
      if:
        - true
      run:
        - action: add-label@v1
        # etr is defined in the last section of this example
          args:
            label: "{{ calc.etr }} min review"
            color: {{ 'E94637' if (calc.etr >= 20) else ('FBBD10' if (calc.etr >= 5) else '36A853') }}
    # Post a comment that lists the best experts for the modified files.
    explain_code_experts:
      if:
        - true
      run:
        - action: explain-code-experts@v1 
          args:
            gt: 10 
  # The next function calculates the estimated time to review and makes it available in the automation above.
  calc:
    etr: {{ branch | estimatedReviewTime }}
```
   
**3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a `.github/workflows/gitstream.yml` file in your repository's default branch to trigger gitStream automations**  
Copy-paste the following configuration file (no need to edit):
```yaml
# Code generated by gitStream GitHub app - DO NOT EDIT

name: gitStream workflow automation
run-name: |
  /:\ gitStream: PR #${{ fromJSON(fromJSON(github.event.inputs.client_payload)).pullRequestNumber }} from ${{ github.event.inputs.full_repository }}

        required: true
      resolver_token:
        description: Optional resolver token for resolver service
        required: false
        default: ''

jobs:
  gitStream:
    timeout-minutes: 5
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: gitStream workflow automation
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate Rules
        uses: linear-b/gitstream-github-action@v1
        id: rules-engine
        with:
          full_repository: ${{ github.event.inputs.full_repository }}
          head_ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.head_ref }}
          base_ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.base_ref }}
          client_payload: ${{ github.event.inputs.client_payload }}

          resolver_url: ${{ github.event.inputs.resolver_url }}
          resolver_token: ${{ github.event.inputs.resolver_token }}

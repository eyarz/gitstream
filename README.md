`gitStream` is a workflow automation tool to optimize your code review process.  
Add context to Pull Requests, find code experts for reviews, and automate the merge process to maximize developer productivity!

## Why gitStream and not GitHub Actions?

gitStream complements, rather than replaces, GitHub Actions and other CI/CD tools like CircleCI or Jenkins.  
While gitStream should be used to enhance the [continuous merge process](https://linearb.io/blog/what-is-continuous-merge) for open-source projects with multiple contributors, GitHub Actions is ideal for other tasks like publishing artifacts and production deployment.

faster  
cheaper  
secure

**Performance**: By not relying on GitHub's runners, gitStream ensures faster results.
**Integrated Tooling**: gitStream comes with built-in tools to optimize your workflow, from code quality checks to automated deployments.
**Security**:
**Cost**: By using gitStream  10% production

## Main Features

### Automated Change Requests

Reduce code review noise by catching issues before anyone invests precious time. Flag [deprecated components](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/change-deprecated-components), [missing data objects](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/change-missing-lambda-field/), [off-limits code](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/close-wrong-team-by-directory/), and other problems that need to be addressed before assigning code reviewers.

### Review Assignment
Effortless Review Assignment

Identifying the correct people to review a PR can take time, particularly for complex projects and repos requiring deep expertise. [Assign code experts](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/standard/review-assignment/assign-code-experts/) to review complex PRs, [notify your security team about sensitive changes](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/standard/review-assignment/review-sensitive-files/), and automatically [assign reviewers based on the contents of the PR](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/assign-reviewers-by-directory/).

### Auto-Merge PRs

Not all PRs need extensive review policies that loop in multiple experts. gitStream lets you auto-merge [safe changes](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/approve-safe-changes/), [small fixes](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/approve-tiny-changes/), [PRs from trusted teams](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/approve-team-by-directory/), and anything else you want to unblock the review process to keep your team focused on their work.

### Contextual Labels

Reduce the mental burden of code reviews with labels that provide a high degree of context. Indicate an [estimated time to review](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/provide-estimated-time-to-review/) or flag potential issues with [Jira information](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/label-missing-jira-info/), [missing tests](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/label-prs-without-tests/), [deleted files](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/label-deleted-files/), and more.

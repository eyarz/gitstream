`gitStream` is a workflow automation tool to optimize your code review process.  
Add context to Pull Requests, find code experts for reviews, and automate the merge process to maximize developer productivity!

## Why gitStream and not GitHub Actions?

gitStream complements, rather than replaces, GitHub Actions and other CI/CD tools like CircleCI or Jenkins.  
While gitStream should be used to enhance the [continuous merge process](https://linearb.io/blog/what-is-continuous-merge) for open-source projects with multiple contributors, GitHub Actions is ideal for other automation tasks like publishing artifacts and deployment to production.  

gitStream bot can _shorten code review cycles by 40%_ with [built-in automation](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/automation-library/) like:

* **Enforce Semantic PR Titles** - enforce pull request naming conventions
* **Calculate percent new code** - post a comment with the percentage of new code
* **Assign code experts** - assign recommended reviewers based on code components
* **Provide estimated time to review** - label PRs estimated number of minutes it would take to review

## Users

Here are some popular open-source projects that are using gitStream automations:
* [gradle/gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/tree/master/.cm) 15.2k ‚≠ê
* [gitcoinco/grants-stack](https://github.com/gitcoinco/grants-stack/tree/main/.cm) 250 ‚≠ê

## Getting started in two min

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [Install the GitHub app from the marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/gitstream-by-linearb)
gitStream is a verified GitHub app that was audited and approved by the GitHub Security team.  

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a `.cm/gitstream.cm` rules file in your repository's default branch (usually `master` or `main`)  
For example, this rule file will add a label with an [estimated time to review](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/provide-estimated-time-to-review/) for every new pull request:

  ```yaml
  # -*- mode: yaml -*-
  # This example configuration for provides basic automations to get started with gitStream.
  # View the gitStream quickstart for more examples: https://docs.gitstream.cm/quick-start/
  manifest:
    version: 1.0
  automations:
    # Add a label indicating how long it will take to review the PR.
    estimated_time_to_review: 
      if:
        - true
      run:
        - action: add-label@v1
        # etr is defined in the last section of this example
          args:
            label: "{{ calc.etr }} min review"
            color: {{ 'E94637' if (calc.etr >= 20) else ('FBBD10' if (calc.etr >= 5) else '36A853') }}
    # Post a comment that lists the best experts for the modified files.
    explain_code_experts:
      if:
        - true
      run:
        - action: explain-code-experts@v1 
          args:
            gt: 10 
  # The next function calculates the estimated time to review and makes it available in the automation above.
  calc:
    etr: {{ branch | estimatedReviewTime }}
```
   
#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a `.github/workflows/gitstream.yml` file in your repository's default branch to trigger gitStream automations  
Copy-paste the following configuration file (**no need to edit**):
```yaml
# Code generated by gitStream GitHub app - DO NOT EDIT

name: gitStream workflow automation
run-name: |
  /:\ gitStream: PR #${{ fromJSON(fromJSON(github.event.inputs.client_payload)).pullRequestNumber }} from ${{ github.event.inputs.full_repository }}

        required: true
      resolver_token:

        required: false
        default: ''

jobs:
  gitStream:
    timeout-minutes: 5
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: gitStream workflow automation
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate Rules
        uses: linear-b/gitstream-github-action@v1
        id: rules-engine
        with:
          full_repository: ${{ github.event.inputs.full_repository }}
          head_ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.head_ref }}
          base_ref: ${{ github.event.inputs.base_ref }}
          client_payload: ${{ github.event.inputs.client_payload }}
          installation_id: ${{ github.event.inputs.installation_id }}
          resolver_url: ${{ github.event.inputs.resolver_url }}
          resolver_token: ${{ github.event.inputs.resolver_token }}

```
> To enforce consistent automations across all repos in your organization. You can define them by creating a special repository named cm in your GitHub organization where you can add automation files that will apply to all repositories within that organization.[Check out our docs for more info](https://docs.gitstream.cm/github-installation/).
